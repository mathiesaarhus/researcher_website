I earned my PhD from University of Southern Denmark in 2020 and have since been employed uninteruptedly in various research positions. Most recently, I have been affiliated with [Gothenburg Research Infrastructure in Digital Humanities](https://www.gu.se/en/digital-humanities) 


## Research Interest

My research interests include digital literature, cultural analytics, social class and demographics. I am currently working on a project which uses book data to investigate inequalities in the cultural market. Prior work focused on working class literature and the literary histories of social concepts like unemployment, precarization and automation.
